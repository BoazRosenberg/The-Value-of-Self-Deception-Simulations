# Agent-Based Learning Simulation Framework

This repository contains a comprehensive framework for simulating agent decision-making and learning processes used in the article "The Value of Self-Deception: Implications of Conflict in
Dual-Process Action Selection"
## Project Structure

### 1. Core Logic
These files constitute the backbone of the framework and define how the agents and the environment interact.
*   **`agent.py`**: The primary backbone of the simulation. It defines the `Agent` class, encompassing state variables, value assessments for different actions, and methods for decision-making and evaluation.
*   **`functions.py`**: Contains essential utility functions used across the entire framework.
*   **`value_functions.py`**: Defines the specific mathematical value functions used by agents to evaluate their states.
*   **`actions.py`**: Contains the logic for both generating possible action sets and for evaluating them by the agent.

### 2. Simulation Wrappers
*   **`defined_simulations.py`**: This file acts as the bridge between the agents and the experiments. 

### 3. Execution
These are the files intended for the end-user. 
*   **`simulation_A.py`**, **`simulation_B.py`**, **`simulation_C.py`**: These scripts run the actual simulations by calling the logic in `defined_simulations.py`. 
    *   Users can open these files to adjust specific parameters or toggle between different versions of a simulation.
    *   Users may also modify `value_functions.py` if they wish to change the value functions used in the simulations (intended primarily for simulation A).

### 4. Data & Learning Shortcuts
*   **`Estimate Learning Processes/`**: Contains `Asymmetric Learning.py`. 
    *   *Note:* This script generates the `S_hat.csv` file, which serves as a computational shortcut for learning processes. **You do not need to run this script**, as the pre-calculated `S_hat.csv` is already included in this repository for immediate use.
*   **`CSV Files/`**: All output data generated by running Simulation A, B, or C are automatically stored in this directory.

### 5. Visualization
*   **`Visualization.R`**: An R script is provided to process the results stored in the `CSV Files` folder and generate high-quality visualizations for analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the simulations, you need Python 3.x installed with the following libraries:
*   `pandas`
*   `numpy`
*   `matplotlib`

### How to Run
1.  **Select a Simulation**: Choose which experiment you wish to run (A, B, or C).
2.  **Configure Parameters**: Open the chosen file (e.g., `simulation_A.py`) and adjust any simulation-specific parameters or versions as needed.
3.  **Execute**: Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python simulation_A.py
    ```
4.  **View Results**: Once the simulation finishes, check the `CSV Files/` directory for the output data.
5.  **Visualize**: Use the provided R script to generate plots from the generated CSV data.
